                        <p>Paul Butler’s Chokehold is a powerful and disturbing exploration of modern American policing and its tragic consequences for black communities across the country.  Butler locates policing within a larger cultural context of white supremacy, entertainment, sports, and a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. Deploying his academic acumen as a legal scholar and his substantial prosecutorial experience in the federal system, Butler produces a searing account of the racialized animus structurally at work in our criminal justice system today.</p>
